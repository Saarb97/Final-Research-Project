Contrary to what many would have expected, the twenty-something actually enjoyed not having a job and talked about how he even just embraces it when others call him a sloth and a drain on society, but the old geezer only spent about two weeks out of work before finding a new employer. The job search was hard, but he said he was glad to have finally found a place to add value to.

3367,"Technology is advancing with a startling pace, and some people have trouble keeping up with the most modern aspects.
