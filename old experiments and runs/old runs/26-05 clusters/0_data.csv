24,"Being unemployed can be really hard, and a recent newspaper article highlighted some difficulties in their interview with a local twenty-something and an old geezer. Contrary to what many would have expected, the twenty-something actually enjoyed not having a job and talked about how he even just embraces it when others call him a sloth and a drain on society, but the old geezer only spent about two weeks out of work before finding a new employer. The job search was hard, but he said he was glad to have finally found a place to add value to.
